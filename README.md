Autonomous hill-climbing for pi-based coding agents: [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) and [omp](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi). You say what should get better. The agent picks metrics and targets, then keeps trying changes until the targets are met.

The agent writes the code. The extension measures, decides and keeps the record, so the agent cannot grade its own work or quit early.

## Install

**pi**

```bash
pi install git:github.com/kubet/pi-climb
```

**omp**

```bash
omp plugin install git+ssh://git@github.com/kubet/pi-climb.git
```

From a local checkout: `pi install ./pi-climb` or `omp install ./pi-climb`.

On omp, a stop hook keeps the agent working and the judge and acceptance review run as independent side turns. pi has neither, so there the heartbeat drives the loop, the agent's own diagnosis stands in for the judge, and achieved goals are marked unreviewed.

Needs a git repo with at least one commit, and a checkout with no other uncommitted work. If the checkout is shared, give the climb its own worktree: `git worktree add ../climb HEAD`, then `/climb move ../climb`.

## Use

```
/climb make the API p50 under 50ms   start a goal (optional: --beat 30m --poke-max 3)
/climb                               progress report
/climb pause | resume                stop / restart the loop
/climb done [goal]                   close a goal
/climb panel                         write .climb/panel.html
/climb move <path>                   carry the climb to another checkout
```

After a restart, continuing the session (`pi -c`, `omp -c`) picks the climb up from its ledger.

## What happens

1. **Probe**: the agent finds candidate metrics; the extension runs each and records the number.
2. **Scorecard**: up to 3 metrics with targets; the extension measures baseline and noise (A/A).
3. **Experiment**: one lever, one hypothesis; the agent edits and commits.
4. **Measure**: the extension measures the commit (A B B A against the base when it's close). Beat the noise: **kept**. Otherwise: **dropped** and auto-reverted. Back to 3.
5. **Summit**: every target met, measured again, then an independent review of the intent: **achieved**.

Meanwhile a heartbeat checks every 30 min; three quiet beats call an independent judge (continue / pivot / stuck). The agent cannot stop while a goal is open.

## Rules the extension enforces

- **It measures, on commits.** The agent never reports its own numbers. A run that crashes decides nothing.
- **Noise is measured, not guessed.** A gain must beat it. Borderline or drifting metrics are re-run interleaved with the base commit (A B B A), so machine drift cancels out. A metric whose pairs are noisier than the whole way to its target can keep nothing: experiments on it wait until the instrument is steadier (or carry a proof).
- **Measuring resumes.** A measurement that is cut off keeps its finished runs and pairs; calling again continues, and cannot re-roll them.
- **Drops revert themselves.** An experiment that touches the benchmark is dropped.
- **Holds guard.** A `hold: true` metric ("no slower") has no target; a real regression drops the experiment.
- **Proofs.** An experiment can carry a check that fails before the change and passes after; that keeps a fix the metrics are too coarse to see.
- **Focus.** One open experiment, at most 3 metrics per goal. Three drops in a row call the judge.
- **Big goals split.** `climb_split` makes 2-4 parts, each with its own scorecard. `climb_learn` records facts, traps and dead ends that survive restarts.
- **Achieved means checked.** Targets met twice, then an independent review of the intent. If no review could run, the goal is marked unreviewed.

## Files

Everything lives in `.climb/` (excluded from git):

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `oracle.jsonl` | every decision, append-only |
| `trace.jsonl` | every run and tool call, with timing and refusals |
| `panel.html` | goal tree, metrics vs targets, experiments |
| `export.json` | evidence rows (benchmaxx schema `climb.export/1`) |

Set `CLIMB_SINK=<https url or shell command>` to stream each decision out. Other extensions can listen with `pi.events.on("climb", …)`.

## Develop

```bash
bun test
```
