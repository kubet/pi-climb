The climb plugin has already run `/climb $ARGUMENTS`; its answer is in the climb context of this message. Act on it: when it started a goal, begin the research it describes. Work through the climb tools (climb_probe, climb_scorecard, climb_experiment, climb_measure, ...), call them directly, and never edit `.climb/`. If no climb context came with this message, say the plugin did not answer and stop.
